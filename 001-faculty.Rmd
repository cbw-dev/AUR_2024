>Investigator I, OICR <br>
Assistant Professor, University of Toronto <br>
>

Dr. Pai integrates genomics and computational methods to advance precision medicine. Her previous work involves DNA methylome-based biomarker discovery in psychosis, and building machine learning algorithms for patient classification from multi-modal data. The Pai Lab at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research focuses on biomarker discovery for detection, diagnosis and prognosis in brain cancers and other brain-related disorders.

#### Chaitra Sarathy

>Bioinformatics Specialist <br>
Krembil Research Institute <br>
>

Dr. Sarathy is a computational biologist with industry experience in software development. Her previous research centered around developing multi-scale mathematical models of human systems to characterise biochemical changes in obesity. In addition, she has developed methods based on machine learning and multi-omics integration to identify drug targets in cancer and stratify patients for clinical trials. She currently focuses on characterizing genetic malfunctions in neurological diseases.

#### Ian Cheong
